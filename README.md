# 🔄 save-my-session

> Transfer coding sessions between AI agents — Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and Codex.

[繁體中文](./README.zh-TW.md)

When you juggle multiple AI coding agents (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex), the painful part isn't running out of quota — it's **rebuilding context from scratch every time you switch**. `save-my-session` converts your session file in one agent directly into another agent's native format. The next agent opens the file, sees the full conversation history, and keeps going. No briefing required.

> **⚠️ Platform support**: macOS / Linux only. Windows is not supported yet (the Claude Code project-slug algorithm needs a Windows-path-aware rewrite).

## Features

- **`transfer`** — convert a Claude / Gemini / Codex session file into another agent's native format, written straight into the target agent's session directory.
- **`install`** — inject a handoff prompt into each agent's global system prompt (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md`, `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`) so each agent can monitor quota and suggest a handoff on its own.
- **`--append`** — merge only the newer messages (by timestamp) from another agent back into your original session, ideal for round-trip handoffs.
- **`--list`** — list all sessions for the current project with last user message, counts, and time range.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g save-my-session
```

Then (optional):

```bash
save-my-session install
```

This appends a block into `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md`, `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` (wrapped in `<!-- save-my-session:start -->` markers so you can `uninstall` cleanly). Each agent will now proactively offer a handoff when it notices rate-limit warnings or an unusually long session.

## Usage

> All commands use `cwd` to identify the project. **Run them from your project root**, or pass `--cwd <path>` explicitly.

### List sessions for the current project

```bash
save-my-session transfer --from claude --list
```

```

### Transfer a session

Latest Claude session → Gemini:

```bash
save-my-session transfer --from claude --to gemini
```

Specify a session file:

```bash
save-my-session transfer --from gemini --to codex --session <path>
```

### Picking up the transferred session

The transfer writes a native session file into the target agent's directory, but **the target CLI does not auto-load the newest session on start**. The standard flow is:

1. Run `save-my-session transfer ...`
2. Open the target CLI (`claude`, `gemini`, or `codex`)
3. Inside the CLI, run `/resume` (or the equivalent history picker) and pick the freshly written session
4. You're now continuing from where the previous agent left off

> 👉 If the target CLI is already running, **close and reopen** so it rescans the session directory.

### Round-trip: append new progress back into the original session

Scenario: you started in Claude → transferred to Gemini → did more work there → want to continue in the **original** Claude session rather than a brand-new one:

```bash
save-my-session transfer --from gemini --to claude --append <path/to/original-claude-session.jsonl>
```

Only messages whose timestamps are **strictly newer** than the target session's last message are appended. Safe to rerun — a second invocation appends 0.

### Remove the injected prompts

```bash
save-my-session uninstall
```

## Where each agent stores sessions

| Agent | Location |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/projects/<path-with-dashes>/<uuid>.jsonl` |
| Gemini CLI | `~/.gemini/tmp/<slug>/chats/session-<ts>-<uuid>.json` (slug mapping in `~/.gemini/projects.json`) |
| Codex | `~/.codex/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-<ts>-<uuid>.jsonl` (`cwd` is inside `session_meta`) |

Transferred files carry a `_transferred_by_save_my_session` marker; `--list` and subsequent transfers skip them to avoid circular copies.

## Architecture

- TypeScript (ESM)
- CLI via Commander.js
- Vitest for unit tests
- Each agent has its own parser + writer; the middle layer is a `UnifiedSession` object.

## Limits

- Only `user` and `assistant` text messages are transferred. `tool_use`, thinking blocks, and similar are skipped (the formats differ too much across agents for lossless conversion).
- Agents do not auto-load the newest session on startup — always use `/resume` (or the history picker) to pick the transferred file.
- `--append` dedup relies on ISO 8601 timestamps being correct on both sides.
